            <p align="center">The first task we want to do is a Simulated Ticket Creation, the objective is to understand 
                              how tickets are created and categorized.   Fill in a simulated ticket form:
                                                                       - Subject,
                                                                       - Issue description,
                                                                       - Category, (eg., Hardware, Software, Network)
                                                                        - Priority Attachments (e.g., screenshot)

                <p align="center"> So here you want to hit the add new ticket button and fill in the form with  whatever issues that may be                                            occuring on your device. Be as descrptive as possible. Put in the ticket the name of the device that is having                                      the issue;whether its a computer, phone or application. Also put in the description when is the next time 
                                   we can get a hold of you or who else can we reach out to that may have the same issue. And also where can we                                        reach you if we can't reach you by email. Now make certain to prioritize ticket impact workflow, whether its at                                     a high importance, medium, or low.
                                   Then in the dropdown you can put the type of device on what needs to be addressed. Whether its a network,                                           hardware, printer, software, or other issue. After you are done you can click on create.

              <p align="center"> How the a ticket looks in a dashboard after you open it 
              <img src="https://imgur.com/ZgV3WgJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" "/> 
              <p align="center">After you have created the ticket you can open the ticket and check it to see if it includes everything you want.
                               So this is how a ticket looks when initially open and this is what the admins will usually see on an open ticket. <br/>
                <br/>
<h2> How to Close a Ticket </h2>                
  So next lets look at how a ticket is closed-
  The objective here is to ensure a ticket is properly resolved and documented.;
  The task here will be to confirm resolution by the user;
  Update the ticket notes; 
  Close the ticket with proper resolution code;
  This will involved a bit of role play. <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/> 
  <p align="center">Public Response
  <img src="https://imgur.com/WvvMQ9l.png" height="80%" width="80%" "/></br>
  <p align="center"> On this task we can see the the internet is not work. Let say that we have resolved the 
   issue and we are ready to close the ticket. How do we close the ticket ? We go to the ticket 
   and write the user, 'Hello we have resolved the issue is it working now ?'. After they response
   in the affirmative this means you can close the ticket.
    <br/>
    <br/>
   <p align="center"> Internal Note
   <img src="https://imgur.com/RnzNGbC.png" height="80%" width="80%" "/>
   <p align="center">Now for documentation you can go to public response drop down and click internal note.
   This is the note only your admin team can see. "Hi resolved this issue by doing etc" then you can hit send to add more documentation.
   Then you can click on the close button and you can filter the ticket into the close file in Spiceworks. So that you can only have current            tickets on your dashboard for clarity and effiecentcy. <br/>

     There are time that there is a problem that you dont have the capacity to complete either becuase you dont have the tool or skill therefore         you need to pass it on to more skill admins to resolve. Click on the ticket and on the left you can hit the assingee button
